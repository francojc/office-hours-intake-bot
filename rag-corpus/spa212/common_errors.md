# SPA 212-T: Common Student Errors and Pain Points

## Grammar Errors

### Ser vs. Estar

- Using ser for temporary states ("Soy cansado" instead of "Estoy cansado")
- Using estar for inherent characteristics ("Está inteligente" instead of "Es inteligente")
- Confusion with adjectives that change meaning (ser aburrido vs. estar aburrido)
- Forgetting estar for location ("Soy en la biblioteca")

### Preterite vs. Imperfect

- Defaulting to preterite for all past events
- Not recognizing imperfect triggers (siempre, todos los días, mientras)
- Difficulty with background/foreground distinction in narration
- Verbs with meaning changes: confusing conocí (met) vs. conocía (knew/was familiar with)
- Irregular preterite stems (tuve, puse, hice, dije, fui)

### Present Perfect and Pluperfect

- Incorrect past participle formation (especially irregulars: escrito, dicho, hecho, visto)
- Separating haber from the participle ("He no comido")
- Confusing when to use present perfect vs. preterite

### Subjunctive

- Not recognizing subjunctive triggers (querer que, es importante que, dudar que)
- Using indicative after expressions of emotion or doubt
- Irregular subjunctive stems (sea, vaya, sepa, haya, dé)
- Confusing indicative vs. subjunctive with creer/no creer
- Difficulty with the concept: "Why can't I just use the regular form?"

### Commands (Imperative)

- Mixing up tú and Ud. command forms
- Negative tú commands (using subjunctive): "No hablas" instead of "No hables"
- Pronoun placement with affirmative vs. negative commands
- Irregular tú commands (ven, di, haz, pon, sal, sé, ten, ve)

### Object Pronouns

- Incorrect placement (before conjugated verb, attached to infinitive/gerund)
- Double object pronoun order (indirect before direct)
- le/les → se before lo/la/los/las
- Forgetting the personal "a" with animate direct objects

### Gustar and Similar Verbs

- Using gustar like English "like" ("Yo gusto..." instead of "Me gusta...")
- Subject-verb agreement confusion (me gusta vs. me gustan)
- Applying the pattern to other verbs (encantar, molestar, importar)

### Conditional and Si Clauses

- Mixing tenses in si clauses ("Si tendría..." instead of "Si tuviera...")
- Using conditional in both clauses
- Confusing the sequence: si + past subjunctive, conditional in result clause

### Adverbial Clauses

- Not recognizing which conjunctions always trigger subjunctive
  (para que, antes de que, a menos que)
- Subjunctive vs. indicative with cuando, después de que
  (future/habitual vs. past events)

## Vocabulary Struggles

- False cognates (embarazada ≠ embarrassed, realizar ≠ realize)
- Gender of nouns (el problema, el tema, la mano)
- Preposition usage differences from English (pensar en, soñar con, depender de)

## Writing and Composition Errors

- Direct translation from English sentence structure
- Overuse of simple sentences; difficulty with complex subordination
- Weak paragraph transitions and thesis development
- Not incorporating vocabulary and structures from current unit
- Accent mark omissions affecting meaning (si vs. sí, el vs. él)

## Oral and Interview Struggles

- Freezing when asked to produce subjunctive spontaneously
- Reverting to present tense when narrating past events
- Difficulty with circumlocution (describing a word they don't know)
- Pronunciation of specific sounds (rr, j, ñ, vowel purity)
